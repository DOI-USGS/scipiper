# scipiper

This package provides support and guidance for project organization and advanced
dependency management (with a shared cache and/or with many downloading or
modeling tasks). Conventions are those agreed on by our USGS-IIDD Data Science
team; however, minor deviations will often be appropriate.

General advice is given in help files and vignettes within this package. Try these:

- `?organization`
- `vignette('remake', package='scipiper')`
- `?sharedcache`
- `?tasktables`

(OK, these aren't actually written yet. But sounds like a good idea, right?)
